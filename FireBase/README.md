# FireBase

Lesson to teach students the basics and fundamentals of using FireBase. 
Taught over the space of two weeks. Students should build a larger project that implements Firebase as their backend. 
Another idea for an assignment is where they store JSON there and can in theory implement their own Rest API. 

At least 4 lessons with assignments should be included.
