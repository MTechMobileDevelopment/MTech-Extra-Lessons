Meant to be taught in two days. Just teach the basics of a unit tests. Have two assignments that should take 20-30min meant to be done in class.
# Testing Concepts
There are many concepts and common practices around Unit Testing that each developer should at least be exposed to and should preferably incorporate into their own personal developing. Today we will go over two of the most prominent concepts: Test Driven Development (TDD) and Dependency Injection/Protocol Oriented Programming (POP).
TDD (Test Driven Development) is a process of programming where you write a unit test before you write the code to make the test pass. This process is said to help developers be more productive and results in a testing suite that is more reliable, causing better software quality (less bugs get introduced to the product because they are caught by the unit tests).
Dependency Injection is a generic programming technique where one decouples code by "injecting" dependencies rather than having explicit dependencies on concrete classes. POP (Protocol Oriented Programming) is a form of Dependency Injection where we use protocols to decouple code and then "inject" any class that conforms to that protocol at run time. The benefit of this programming technique is that it allows you to create controlled, testable dependencies and insert them at run time to allow better unit testing.

# Learing Outcomes #

- Learn what TDD (Test Driven Development) is and why it is useful.
- Understand the basic concept of Dependency Injection and POP (Procedural Oriented Programming) and how it makes code testable.
- Be able to apply TDD and POP to improve Unit Tests of personal iOS projects.

## Lesson ##

Go in depth on the subject. Show code examples. Remember that teachers will be covering this material. Make it easy to follow along. Easy for the teacher to pick it up and go.

As well it will be good for the students to be able to come back to the lesson and understand without a teacher directing them.

## Assignment ##

20-30 minute assignment for them to work on during class. Wraps up the lesson and has the student implement what they learned. An assignment that brings in all of the learning outcomes for the lesson.

## Quiz ##

10 questions to cover the unit. Easy. We want the students to be able to get 100% on the quiz with ease.

## Project ##

This project is meant to be done solely in class. A list of instructions with no solution code. Students should struggle to work through these. Help from their fellow students and the teacher should be necessary in order to finish the project. A project can take a whole week. A week of lesson then the next week project is fine.
