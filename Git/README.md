# Git

Git is a version control system for tracking changes in files, and being able to collaborate with others to work on the same files together. This lesson will teach students how to use Git and how it is used in order to collaborate with others. It is critical in a work environment to be competent with Git. It is the primary mode in which you will submit and recieve code to craft into mobile applications.

# Learing Outcomes #

- Be able to create a new repository and commit to it.
- Be able to clone a repository and contribute to it
- Be able to use XCode as a GUI for their repositories.
- Be able to successfully work with a partner to work on a project.

## Repositories ##

A repository is the home for your code. Changes that you make in code will be reflected in your repository for that code. All folders and files in your projects can be stored in a repository. There are many services online that you can utilitize to save your repositories. For this class, and for many people in the iOS community Github will be our service that we use. So, how do we start with a repository on GitHub? All you need to start is a name, but you also will have many options to include which we will cover.

Typically you keep the repository name to be the same as your project. So for a Journal App your repository could be Journal, or the name of your app.

You get the option to make the repository public or private. With a free account you will only be able to create a public repositories. A public repository means that anyone on the internet would be able to open and look at your code. A private repository only lets you and your collaborators access the repository. Students can qualify for Github for free! Check out the Student Developer Pack in Additional Resources.

In addition your repository can include a README. When possible you should create a README for all of your repositories. Consider this as an introduction to what your repository is all about. Take a look at how we use README's in this Repository.

The last two options you get are to add a .gitignore and a license. The Git Ignore is way to hide files in your repository. A good example is .DS_Store. That type of file type is a nuisance as it is created whenever you create new files and folders. Adding .DS_Store to your .gitignore is common practice. Licenses are there to protect you. For example, if you had a code base that other people are using. You will want to be acknowleged for your work and so a Apache License will require anyone using your code to provide attibution to you.

Apple has recently made a push to incorporate XCode with Github. You will find many helpful tools along the way that integrate XCode with Github. One instance would be if you are on a repository on Github and want to see the project in XCode there is a Open in Xcode button.

There are millions of repositories on GitHub. The public repositories you can access and learn from. If you just want to open the project then you can download the ZIP or Open in Xcode as you can see from above. However, you have other options depending on what you want to do.

Your first option would be to Clone. Cloning a Repository gives you a copy of the code that is in the repository. Another option is to Fork. When you fork a Repository then you create a new repository that is identical to the original, but it is now on your Github account. Remember if you ever decide to use code from other people they probably have a license so you will need to attribute them in your project.

# Assignment #

20-30 minute assignment for them to work on during class. Wraps up the lesson and has the student implement what they learned. An assignment that brings in all of the learning outcomes for the lesson.

# Quiz #

10 questions to cover the unit. Easy. We want the students to be able to get 100% on the quiz with ease.
