## Lesson ##

Go in depth on the subject. Show code examples. Remember that teachers will be covering this material. Make it easy to follow along. Easy for the teacher to pick it up and go.

As well it will be good for the students to be able to come back to the lesson and understand without a teacher directing them.

## Assignment ##

20-30 minute assignment for them to work on during class. Wraps up the lesson and has the student implement what they learned. An assignment that brings in all of the learning outcomes for the lesson.

## Quiz ##

10 questions to cover the unit. Easy. We want the students to be able to get 100% on the quiz with ease.

## Project ##

This project is meant to be done solely in class. A list of instructions with no solution code. Students should struggle to work through these. Help from their fellow students and the teacher should be necessary in order to finish the project. A project can take a whole week. A week of lesson then the next week project is fine.
